# Xpoints
Exploring XGphilosophy, some basic implementations using data from understat.com's functions.  
XG - expected goals (The number of goals you would expect a team to score based on the chances they created.)
XP - expected points (The number of points a team is expected to get based on their chances being converted to goals)

Test it on your favourite team(limited to epl for now):
- Clone the repo
- install requirements
- python fetch_main.py *team_name*  *season*  

TODO:
- for all leagues
- currently fetches and calculates for all the games of a particular season; try for latest matchweek of all teams
- maybe a bot to tweet xpoints after each game
