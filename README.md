# Xpoints
Exploring XGphilosophy, some basic implementations using data from understat.com's functions.

Test it on your favourite team(limited to epl for now):
- Clone the repo
- install requirements
- python fetch_main.py <team_name> <sesason>

TODO:
- for all leagues
- currently fetches and calculates for all the games of a particular season; try for latest matchweek of all teams
- maybe a bot to tweet xpoints after each game
